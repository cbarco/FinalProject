Here I created a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that we have built along the Data Science Capstone Course and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others as the Final Project of the Data Science Specialization by the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. 

All data used can be found here on the GitHub repository https://github.com/cbarco/FinalProject 

### How did I do it?
1. I combined the english databases and clean those to create a corpus
2. Created 4 databases: unigram, bigram, trigram and quadgram, to use in the prediction model
3. I created the prediction model based on previous menctioned databases
4. Created the interface of the APP, so it can be easily understood and used by all people, whether or not they are data scientists. 


### How to use it?
1. Please check on the top of your screen were you will find two tabs, right now you are on the About tab
2. Select the Next Word Predictor tab to start using it
2. In the box, write a sentence without the last word you want to know
3. The Next Word Predictor APP will let you know what word should be after

Thank you very much
